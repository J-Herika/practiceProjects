  what is the problem??

  1- the playGame() is in the eventListener
  - so it plays all the rounds at once.
  2- how to make it play round by round??
    - the user clicks and plays in his own term i don't control it he does.
    - so i have to set it around when he clicks
    steps:
      1- human chooses a choice.
      2- get the computer choice.
      3- add points to who won.
      4- check if the point reached 5. if it did end game. else continue.
